**Market Definition of Orthopedic Biomaterials**

Orthopedic biomaterials are intended to be transplanted into the human body as components crafted to perform specific biological activities such as substituting or restoring diverse tissues such as bone, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons, and even leading bone repair when necessary. Implants are biomaterial devices used in orthopedics; they are developed for several orthopedic uses. Human bone allografts are also considered biomaterials as they are used in several orthopedic surgery procedures. These materials are particularly divided into three categories that are polymers, ceramics, and metals.

**Global Orthopedic Biomaterials Market: Growth Drivers**

The growth of the global orthopedic biomaterials market can majorly be attributed to the escalating ratio of trauma cases in working people across the globe, which has been affecting the lives of people on a larger scale. For instance, every year, around 41 million individuals are permanently injured, with more than 100 million temporarily injured. Trauma-related fatalities in the working population are increasing worldwide, resulting in around 7 million deaths each year, which is more than all communicable diseases combined, including HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and COVID-19. On the other hand, the market growth can also be attributed to a significant upsurge in the count of hip arthroplasty, which is also projected to drive the market growth. For instance, in 2020, the worldwide number of hip arthroplasties expanded to around 49,000, which denotes around a 35% upsurge, and it is expected to climb by nearly 74% to 653,000 arthroplasties by 2025.

The global orthopedic biomaterials market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following:

- Increasing Number of Sports Injuries
- Rising Population of Geriatric People
- Worldwide Proliferation in Orthopedic Procedures
- Rising Count of Patients Opting for Knee Replacement

**Global Orthopedic Biomaterials Market: Restraining Factor**

The dearth of reimbursement for orthopedic procedures is estimated to lower the demand for orthopedic procedures. Since the large proportion of these surgeries entailed severe bone fractures that require surgical repair with hardware insertion such as internal fixing but over time, the surge in consumer price index (CPI) has led the situation to develop into a shortage of reimbursement for orthopedic procedures. Hence, this factor is expected to be the major hindrance to the growth of the global orthopedic biomaterials market during the forecast period.

**Global Orthopedic Biomaterials Market Segmentation**  

- **By Application (Joint Reconstruction, Bio-Resorbable Tissue Fixation, and Orthopedic Implants)**

  The orthopedic implants segment, amongst all the other segments, is anticipated to garner the largest revenue by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the significantly expanding prevalence of disc degenerative disorders and bone fractures, followed by the surge in trauma cases of road accidents across the globe. For instance, around 41% of adults over the age of 40 have at least one degenerative spinal disc. Such a proportion of disc degenerative disorders is estimated to push the market growth further over the forecast period. 

- **By Material (Ceramics & Bioactive Glasses, Polymers, Metals, and Calcium Phosphate Cements)**
- **By Region**

  The North American orthopedic biomaterials market is anticipated to hold the largest market share by the end of 2035 among the market in all the other regions, backed by the escalating number of orthopedic surgeries such as reconstruction, and knee replacement, and so on, along with the rapidly rising ratio of aged people. For instance, in the United States, there were almost 6 million orthopedic surgeries were performed in 2021. Furthermore, the rapid adoption of advanced products for bone void filling and implant load-bearing is also expected to further accelerate the market size throughout the forecast period in the region.
