**Growing Utilization of GPU in AI Training to Promote Global Market Share of Data Center Liquid Cooling** 

The global data center liquid cooling market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased usage of GPU in AI training. The effects are felt throughout the enterprise's servers as a result of growing adaptation to AI and big data. Traditional microprocessors did not process the information coming from data center GPUs in an efficient manner. Datacenter GPUs are used for data center applications, including information on Deep Learning Technologies, and enterprise-level performance, and have been developed to handle larger-scale projects. The increased use of GPU worldwide also leads to a rise in the consumption of data center air conditioning.
