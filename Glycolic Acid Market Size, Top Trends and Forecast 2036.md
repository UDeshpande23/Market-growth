Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global glycolic acid market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing consumer awareness of skin health and their willingness to invest in skin care products 
- Growing popularity regarding the use of organic and natural products, which has encouraged manufacturers to produce products with low side effects

**Challenges:**

The increasing cost of raw materials and the stringent regulatory environment for the production of glycolic acid are expected to limit the growth of the global market. Additionally, glycolic acid is an exfoliant that can irritate and dry out skin if used too frequently or in too high of a concentration. Additionally, it can make underlying skin conditions such as acne and eczema worse. As a result, people are becoming more cautious of using glycolic acid and its associated health risks, which is leading to a decrease in demand for the product.

By application, the global glycolic acid market is segmented into personal care & dermatology, tanning & dyeing, agriculture, medical, and food. The personal care & dermatology segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period This is because glycolic acid has a wide range of uses in the personal care and dermatology industry, such as exfoliants, moisturizers, anti-aging creams, and acne treatments. Its ability to effectively and gently remove dead skin cells and excess oil, while stimulating collagen production, make it a popular choice for many personal care products. Moreover, the increasing awareness of skin-related health among consumers, the growing popularity of organic and natural beauty products, and the rising demand for anti-aging products are some of the other factors that are expected to drive the segment’s growth.
