These factors are majorly contributing to the market growth of healthcare virtual assistants.

By product, the global healthcare virtual assistants market is segmented into smart speakers, web-based chatbots, and mobile-based chatbots. The smart speakers segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The expansion can be attributed to consumers' growing appetite for high-tech goods. Smart speakers offer solutions that are versatile, quick, diversified, and trustworthy. Users may use voice commands to check their health, inquire about medical conditions, and receive medication reminders on the smart speakers, which offer hands-free access to healthcare information. For instance, in the United States, there were approximately 91 million smart speakers installed, up from 47.3 million in 2018. The installed base of smart speakers increased to over 95 million devices in 2022. These factors are driving the expansion of the segment. 

The market in North America is expected to hold a share of 36% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to the growing cases of chronic diseases such as heart ailments, and diabetes in the region. Cardiovascular disease claims one life in the United States every 33 seconds. In the United States, heart disease claimed the lives of almost 695,000 persons in 2021. Additionally, it is predicted that the market will profit from the expansion of healthcare facilities in the area throughout the course of the forecast period. Moreover, the industry is expanding as smart speakers are being used by more end users.
