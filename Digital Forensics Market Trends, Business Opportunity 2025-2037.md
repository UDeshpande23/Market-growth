**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Cyber Crimes to Drive Growth of Global Digital Forensics Market**

The global digital forensics market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased rate of cybercrimes against individuals, companies, corporates and BFSI sectors. For instance, nearly 1 billion emails were exposed in the year 2022. Around USD 236.1 million ransomware attacks occurred globally in the year 2022. Further, the cost of cybercrime is projected to reach USD 10.5 trillion by the year 2025. On the basis of growing rates of cybercrimes, the United States government imposed a law for private sector companies to maintain a cyber protection team (CPT) so as to provide quick and advanced analysis of any ongoing or predicted cyberattacks.
