**Pelletized Activated Carbon Market Size, Growth Drivers and Analysis 2036**

The Asia Pacific [**pelletized activated carbon market**](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/pelletized-activated-carbon-market/5093) is expected to earn its greatest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the presence of cities with maximum levels of pollutants in the air. Furthermore, the market in Europe is also expected to grow significantly during the projected time frame. European countries have implemented strict environmental regulations to curb air and water pollution. These regulations impose stringent emission limits and wastewater treatment standards on industries. On the other hand, Europe is at the forefront of renewable energy adoption and is actively promoting sustainable energy sources, which has further boosted the market growth in the region.

**Growing Air Pollution to Promote Global Market Share of Pelletized Activated Carbon**

The global pelletized activated carbon market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising levels of air pollution in the world and the rise in the actions taken by governments of various nations to curb the pollution levels. Pelletized activated carbon is commonly employed in air filtration systems, such as activated carbon filters or carbon beds. These filters are installed in ventilation systems or air purifiers to remove harmful pollutants from the air. The porous structure of the activated carbon pellets allows them to trap and adsorb a wide range of airborne contaminants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), odors, gases, and particulate matter. According to the World Health Organization, in spite of improvement in some areas, overall urban air pollution levels increased by 8%.

Besides this, the rapid expansion of industrialization and the growing use of fuel cell has also contributed to the market growth. Alongside air pollutants, industrial activities can also generate strong odors, which can be a nuisance to surrounding communities. Activated carbon is commonly employed in industrial facilities, such as wastewater treatment plants, food processing units, and manufacturing plants, to control odorous emissions. Furthermore, fuel cells typically require a catalyst to facilitate the electrochemical reactions at the electrode surfaces. Pelletized activated carbon can serve as a support material for the catalyst used in fuel cell electrodes.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global pelletized activated carbon market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Toxic Pollutants in the Air
- Growing Need for Removing Mercury from the Atmosphere

**Challenges:**

The use of activated carbon for water treatment faces competition from a lot of alternatives are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of pelletized activated carbon. The water treatment industry offers a range of alternative technologies, such as membrane filtration, ion exchange resins, and advanced oxidation processes. These technologies may be more cost-effective or offer specific advantages in certain applications, posing competition to the market. On the other hand, the adsorption capacity of activated carbon pellets is limited. Pelletized activated carbon has a finite adsorption capacity, meaning it can only adsorb a certain number of contaminants before becoming saturated. The effectiveness of activated carbon is influenced by the concentration and characteristics of the contaminants in the water. In cases where the concentration of contaminants is high or these are specific challenging pollutants, additional treatment processes of higher constant times may be required.

The global pelletized activated carbon market is divided into automotive, pharmaceutical, agriculture, mining, oil & gas, chemical, food & beverage, and manufacturing on the basis of end users. The automotive segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Modern vehicles often feature cabin air purification systems that utilize pelletized activated carbon. These systems help in removing pollutants, allergens, and odors from the air inside the vehicle, providing a healthier and more comfortable environment for the occupants. Furthermore, the market is split by application into metal recovery, water & wastewater treatment, filter, air & gas treatment, mercury removal, and catalyst. Out of all, the water and wastewater treatment is expected to generate the highest market revenue over the forecast period.
