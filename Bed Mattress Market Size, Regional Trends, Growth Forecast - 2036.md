**Rising Instances of Sleeping Disorder to Drive Growth of Bed Mattress Market** 

The increasing prevalence of sleeping disorders is a significant reason that is predicted to increase demand for specialty mattresses in the upcoming years. By supporting particular sleeping positions, improving comfort, and straightening the spine, certain types of bed mattresses may help treat sleep disorders. These mattresses support spinal alignment and cushion pressure spots to help reduce or eliminate back and neck pain. There are varieties of bed mattresses that are specifically designed to treat sleep disorders. Mattresses with lots of cushioning are frequently preferred by side sleepers as they can relieve pressure points in the hips and shoulders. Currently, there are a wide range of products in the market that offer utmost comfort. For instance, Helix Midnight's thick foam comfort system comes with a strong coil system that supports a sound sleeping position. Additionally, there is an increasing trend toward personalization, with businesses selling custom mattresses made to fit specific body shapes and preferences. Customers are willing to pay more for a comfortable and customized sleeping experience, which is why these products are becoming more and more popular. Overall, the industry is changing quickly as new firms come onto the scene and established businesses adjust to suit shifting consumer preferences.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the bed mattress industry are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Migration to Urban Areas 
- Rising Home Construction.

**Challenges:**

Bed mattresses made from latex are usually costlier than other types of mattresses. The price of latex mattresses can range from USD 1,300 to USD 3,000. The high price of these latex mattresses is expected to limit the market growth in the upcoming years. 

By type, the bed mattresses are categorized into spring/coil, memory foam, latex, and others. The spring/coil segment is expected to hold a significant share over the forecast period with total sales reaching 578.00 million units by the end of 2030. This is primarily attributed to the fact that spring/coil mattresses have inherent properties such as greater load-bearing capacity and ease of adaptation to body postures. Besides, spring/coil mattresses are made up of high-density foam for better spinal support and they can support even heavy loads owing to the durable coil material in them.

One of the main factors fueling the industry growth in the region is the changing preference of consumers towards villas and bungalows with multiple bedrooms coupled with the rising per capita income of the individual. In addition, the growing emphasis on healthy sleep to improve overall health coupled with the technological innovations witnessed by the mattresses will also speed up the market growth in the future. Besides, the rising number of clinics, hospitals, ambulatory services, and the developing healthcare industry also aids in the elevating demand of bed mattresses. As per the data unveiled by Eurostat, a total count of 2.4 million hospital beds was available across the EU-27 in 2018.
