Additionally, the metal industry also has a huge requirement for can coatings. Since more and more people effortlessly consume canned food and beverages, there is increasing consumer demand for metal packaging. Metal packaging is ideal for beverage containers as it is simple to cool, fantastic for maintaining the contents' freshness, and reduces breakages in transport owing to the material's toughness. Can coatings are employed in metal packaging, as they offer properties such as resistance to food and acidic substances. Further, metal-based packaging is easily moldable into a wide range of shapes, provides excellent protection against light, gas & moisture, and can be recycled and used eternally since it is a highly sustainable material.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global drug delivery systems market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Demand for Aerosol Cans
- Rising Urban Population 

**Challenges:**

The inadequate raw materials to meet demand, and the stringent regulations developed by the government of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global can coatings market. For instance, the vinyl and polyester used in can coatings are petroleum-based raw ingredients. As a consequence of fluctuations in the price of petroleum, manufacturers of coatings have been announcing price increases. It is predicted that the market would be impacted by price volatility. Thus, it is anticipated that over the projected period, this factor would limit the market growth.

By application, the global can coatings market is segmented into beverage can, food can, the general line can, aerosol can, and others. The beverage can segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The soaring demand for beverage cans is to blame for the segment's expansion. For instance, rising demand for beverages such as beer, cider, and carbonated soft drinks has boosted the manufacture of cans, which in turn has increased demand for can coating. Owing to the government-imposed bans on plastic packaging and growing concerns about sustainability, the use of beverage cans is increasing. Furthermore, coatings make cans very resistant to chemicals and moisture, reducing beverage contamination brought on by metal reactions. According to data, the market share of cans for American beer and hard soda increased by more than 60%.

Almost 50% of the population of Asia will reside in cities by the year 2030.

The North American can coatings market, amongst the market in all the other regions, is projected to grow with the highest CAGR during the forecast period.
