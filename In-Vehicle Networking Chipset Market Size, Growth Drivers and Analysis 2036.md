**In-Vehicle Networking Chipset Market Size, Growth Drivers and Analysis 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[In-Vehicle Networking Chipset Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/in-vehicle-networking-chipset-market/2914): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global in-vehicle networking chipset market in terms of market segmentation by product, vehicle type, application, and by region. 

**Rise in Need to Track CO2 to Boost the Growth of Global In-Vehicle Networking Chipset Market** 

The global in-vehicle networking chipset market is set to grow on account of the rising need to track C02. When driving for a long time, the concentration of CO2 in the cabin rises and breathing causes the oxygen supply to fall. Depletion of oxygen leads to fatigue and drowsy driving. As a result, CO2 reduces O2 levels, wears out drivers, and impairs their motor coordination and judgment. Therefore, to improve fatigue prevention tactics, an autonomous system that can detect air pollution in cars while they are driving is needed, as well as an air quality enhancement system.

Additionally, along with its precious metals, the development of chips in the electric vehicle (EV) business allows designers to power their vehicles' battery systems and enable features like firmware upgrades, which have grown increasingly significant in today's automotive industry. In electric vehicles (EVs), sophisticated electronics and semiconductor chips may improve battery performance by pushing the battery towards higher voltages and more efficient onboard chargers. A portfolio of fully integrated GaN power devices, isolated gate drivers, and real-time microcontrollers can be used by the car designer to facilitate efficient and rapid EV charging. As a result, it is anticipated that the in-vehicle networking chipset market would expand in revenue.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global in-vehicle networking chipset market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Demand for Smartphones 
- Rising Adoption of Autonomous Vehicles 

**Challenges:**

Since cars have so much hardware and software content that allows for more automation, they really present a lot of potential sources of security risk, much like many of our other smart, connected IoT devices. The electronic control units (ECUs) are among the risks. Other security vulnerabilities in cars exist besides ECUs, which might allow an intruder to move easily from one internal part of the vehicle to another. For example, the infotainment system uses cellular networks to access services such as location-based roadside assistance, remote car diagnostics, and firmware updates for automakers' vehicles. It follows that over the ensuing years, market expansion is anticipated to be limited.

By vehicles, the market for in-vehicle networking chipset is segmented into passenger vehicles, and commercial vehicles. Out of these segments, the passenger vehicles segment is predicted to capture the highest market share of about 60% over the coming years. However, the commercial vehicle segment is also estimated to grow. Commercial vehicles, such as trucks, buses, and delivery vans, require dependable and efficient communication networks to enable features like Fleet Management, telematics, remote diagnostics, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In-car networks enable fleet managers to optimize vehicle performance, reduce downtime, and improve overall operating effectiveness through real-time data interchange, remote monitoring, and diagnostics. Furthermore, the increasing popularity of electric commercial vehicles is driving the need for complex in-vehicle networks to handle power distribution, charging infrastructure, and battery management systems. The growing emphasis on sustainability, fuel efficiency, and regulatory compliance in the commercial vehicle industry is expected to drive the popularity of in-vehicle networks in this market.  

By region, the Asia Pacific market for in-vehicle networking chipset is set to grow over the forecast period. With countries including South Korea, Japan, and China at the forefront of the car industry, this region has the biggest auto market in terms of both sales and production. Strong and reliable in-car networks are becoming more and more necessary as electric and hybrid vehicles become more common in countries like China, and car owners want more entertainment and telematics features. Increased disposable income, changing consumer preferences, and urbanization are also driving demand for passenger automobiles in the Asia Pacific region, which is driving up demand for in-vehicle networks.
