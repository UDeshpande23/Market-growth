Individuals who suffer from long-term lung conditions like bronchiectasis or Emphysema are more vulnerable to infections. In certain cases, infections from histoplasmosis can cause discomfort and swelling throughout the body. In addition, the market for treatments for histoplasmosis will be propelled by the aging population as well as the increasing incidence of organ failure and AIDS. Another important factor propelling the market is the rising incidence of cancer.
