Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[GPU as a Service (GPUaaS) Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/gpu-as-a-service-gpuaas-market/4721): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global GPU as a service (GPUaaS) market in terms of market segmentation by component, delivery model, application, and by region. 

**Growing Demand for Autonomous Vehicles to Promote Global Market Share of  GPU as a Service (GPUaaS)**

The global GPU as a service market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. By 2035, autonomous driving can create USD 300 to USD 400 billion in revenue. The GPU is fully capable of handling the processing requirements of ADAS and autonomous vehicle technologies, especially in the areas of parallel signal processing and image analysis. The GPU is predicted to take the role of the autonomous vehicle's workhorse since it has the computational capabilities that is expected to enable future cars to become more aware of and responsive to their surroundings, enabling them to function dependably, efficiently, and safely. Therefore, it is predicted that the demand for autonomous vehicles is poised to rise as a result of the rising incidence of traffic accidents, further increasing market growth. However, larger and more powerful GPUs would be required as ADAS platforms demand higher levels of performance. Thus, manufacturers are focusing more on advancing their GPU to satisfy a growing need, which is also predicted to propel the market growth in the upcoming times.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global GPU as a service (GPUaaS) market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Government Initiative towards the Development of Smart City  
- Surge in the Implementation of Cloud-Based Services 

**Challenges:**

The GPUs are difficult to build of greater quality than those of earlier generations. One of the significant factors contributing to the high price is the higher manufacturing expenses. Furthermore, global chip shortages are Another factor that is expected to make GPUs higher in cost. The absence of competition between the end of 2010s and the beginning of 2020s specifically from AMD is another factor raising the cost of GPU. Therefore, the high cost of GPU is one of the significant factors hampering the growth of this market. Also, the lack of awareness among people regarding this technology is another factor expected to hamper the market growth in upcoming times. These are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of GPU as a service (GPUaaS).

By Delivery Mode, the global GPU as a service (GPUaaS) market is segmented into public cloud, hybrid cloud, and private cloud. The hybrid cloud segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Using only one strategy can be insufficient for a lot of businesses. Therefore, applying both private cloud resources from the service provider and on-premises systems, the hybrid cloud combines both in terms of benefits from the security and management of each. Moreover, a large number of businesses are focusing on adopting hybrid cloud technology in the forecast period. Therefore, considering the high demand for GPUaaS is expected to grow.
