**Expanding Food & Beverage Sector & Rising Awareness about Food Safety and quality to Promote the Global Market Share of Food Grade Butyric Acid** 

Globally, the food and beverage industry is experiencing a strong growth. Demand for food additives such as food grade butyric acid is expected to increase due to the need of taste, flavor, and shelf life improvements in an expanding industrial sector. A study has shown that 60 % of foods bought in the US contain technical food additives, including coloring agents, preservatives, and sweeteners. Since 2001, this is an increase of 10%. The findings also show that manufacturers increased the average number of additives in purchased food and beverage products from 3.7 in 2001 to 4.5 in 2019, a clear indication that the prevalence of additives in foodstuffs is increasing. Further, increased consumption of processed and convenience foods has been driven by changing lifestyle patterns and busy schedules for consumers. In order to enhance flavor and prolong the shelf life of these products, food grade butyric acid has a major role to play.
