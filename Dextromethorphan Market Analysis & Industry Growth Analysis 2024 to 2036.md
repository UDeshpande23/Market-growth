**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Acute and Chronic Bronchitis to Drive Growth of Global Dextromethorphan Market**

The global dextromethorphan market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased number of individuals diagnosed with respiratory problems such as cold and cough, asthma, sore throat, tuberculosis, and others. As dextromethorphan is considered to be an effective drug in treating cough-related illnesses, the growing cases of such disorders are expected to raise the utilization rate of dextromethorphan during the analysis period. Furthermore, the incidences such as COVID-19, influenza, diphtheria, and others are also estimated to increase the occurrence of pertussis, and other types of coughs including wet cough, dry cough, paroxysmal cough, croup cough, and others which are further expected to generate the need for dextromethorphan for timely treatment.
