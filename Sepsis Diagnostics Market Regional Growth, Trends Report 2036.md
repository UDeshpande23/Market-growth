**Sepsis Diagnostics Market Regional Growth, Trends Report 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Sepsis Diagnostics Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/sepsis-diagnostics-market/4869): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global sepsis diagnostics market in terms of market segmentation by product, technology, pathogen, testing type, and by region. 

**Growing Incidence of Hospital-Acquired Infections to Promote Global Market Share of Sepsis Diagnostics**

The global sepsis diagnostics market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing cases of hospital-acquired infections. For instance, nosocomial infections sometimes referred to as hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), are a major source of morbidity and mortality around the world. The three most common illnesses picked up in hospitals are urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and sepsis. In patients with weakened immune systems, elderly people, and those with chronic conditions, HAIs can lead to sepsis. The prevalence of sepsis among hospitalized patients increases by 8.7% yearly in the United States. According to estimates, there are more than 1,000,000 cases of sepsis among hospitalized patients in the US per year.

The global sepsis diagnostics market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing geriatric population across the globe. For instance, the elderly population is more prone to sepsis and the rising number of elderly populations across the globe is estimated to drive market growth. In 2020, there were more people over the age of 60 than children under five, and by 2050, it is predicted that 80% of the world's old people will live in low- and middle-income countries.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global sepsis diagnostics market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Pneumonia Cases,
- Creation of Rapid Diagnostic Methods for the Diagnosis of Sepsis

**Challenges:**

The exorbitant cost of diagnostic services and the lack of trained healthcare professionals are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of sepsis diagnostics. One of the key issues expected to slow the market's growth is the public's growing worry over the high price of diagnostic tools. When compared to blood culture tests, which can be purchased for as little as USD 28–35, the price of molecular diagnostic testing is between USD 300 and USD 3,000, which is extremely high.

By product, the global sepsis diagnostics market is segmented into IBS with assay kits & reagents and blood culture media. The blood culture media segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The reason behind the growth of the segment can be attributed to growing benefits such as convenience and cost-effectiveness of this mode of testing. Besides this, the market is anticipated to develop as a result of hospitals and pathology labs using blood culture media more frequently. In an experimental investigation on sepsis patients from Thailand, it was discovered that the Sepifast method, which uses PCR techniques, had a higher diagnostic performance when compared to blood cultures. Furthermore, it is also highlighted that instrument segments would continue to expand during the projected period as a result of rising healthcare awareness and an increase in surgical procedures.

By region, the North American sepsis diagnostics market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the well-established healthcare infrastructure in the region. As a result, more sophisticated diagnostic tools and software are now being employed throughout the area. Additionally, a substantial presence of significant competitors and an effective reimbursement system throughout that region help the market to expand. A high rate of sepsis and infectious disorders is also projected to increase the need for novel diagnostics technologies. Therefore, owing to the huge count of cases in the nation, its diagnosis is expected to rise and the market is projected to expand. Increasing funding for sepsis research and development is estimated to additionally assist in strengthening the market. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 2021, sepsis affected over 1.7 million adults in the United States and caused close to 270,000 deaths.
