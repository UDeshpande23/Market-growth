The global industrial boiler maintenance market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing agriculture sector. For instance, the global agriculture market is anticipated to expand by over 5% from 2023 to 2028. Numerous uses for steam boilers can be found in the agricultural industry such as to dry crops to reduce the moisture content, maintain optimal temperature in greenhouses, and to power machinery for several tasks. Therefore, more boilers are being installed to meet these needs which has led to an increase in demand for maintenance and repair so that the boilers operate efficiently.

Further, the rising usage of industrial boilers in laundries is expected to drive market growth. Industrial boilers are essential for running steam irons and presses, heating hot water, steam ironing, and other steam-related equipment in many laundry service companies, making them the best choice for their industry. Since industrial boilers can lose performance with time therefore it is highly advised to do routine boiler maintenance because it can increase operational efficiencies and increase the effectiveness and safety of laundry operations.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global industrial boiler maintenance market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Personal Disposable Income Globally
- Rising Demand for Oil & Gas

**Challenges:**

The shortage of skilled labor and the stringent regulations developed by the governments of nations worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of industrial boiler maintenance. For repairing industrial boilers skilled professionals are required, which are difficult to find and are often expensive to acquire. This makes it difficult for companies with limited budgets to carry the maintenance tasks regularly.

By boiler type, the global industrial boiler maintenance market is segmented into fire-tube, and water-tube. The water-tube segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. A water-tube boiler is a type of boiler that produces steam using tubes filled with water and also circulates water inside tubes that are surrounded by a heat source. These boilers are useful for applications such as steam turbine power generation and are commonly used in process industries, including chemicals, refining, and pulp and paper manufacturing applications where high-pressure steam is required.

Additionally, the fire-tube boiler may also gain a notable share by the year 2036. Fire tube boilers heat water in a sealed container by burning fuel and can be used for several commercial and industrial uses, including heating, energy production, and process steam. They offer several benefits such as their small size, inexpensive initial investment, and easy maintenance which makes them ideal for low-pressure and low-steam generation applications such as sugar mills, pulp, and paper industries.

By region, the North America industrial boiler maintenance market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by the growing pulp & paper industry. The world's top producer of paper pulp is the United States, with more than 22% of the world's paper production capacity. This industry widely uses industrial boilers for paper drying, which may drive the need for maintenance and repair for the boilers.

This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global industrial boiler maintenance market which includes company profiling of General Electric Company, Hurst Boiler & Welding Co, Inc., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Robert Bosch GmbH, The IBL Group, Thermax Global, WIKA Instruments India Pvt. Ltd., Stork B.V., Jera Power Taketoyo G.K., and others.
