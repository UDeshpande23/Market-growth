Besides this, market growth is also expected owing to the rising demand for adhesives and sealants in the construction and automotive industry. Adhesives are used to bond various automotive components, such as body panels, roof systems, doors, and interior trim. It provides excellent bonding, distributes the load of the components evenly, and improves overall vehicle stiffness. Moreover, the popularity of electric vehicles has further increased the use of adhesives & sealants, since they are employed in the assembly of batteries of the vehicles. EV sales surpassed 10 million, with electric vehicles accounting for 14% of all new vehicles sold, a significant increase from 9% in 2021 compared to less than 5% in 2020. As a result, a total of 26 million electric cars are deployed on worldwide roads in 2022.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global adhesives & sealants market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Use of Adhesives in the Construction Industry
- Growing Demand for Consumer Electronics

**Challenges:**

Fluctuation rules and regulations for the production of adhesives and sealants and growing prices of raw materials used for its production. Both of these factors slow down the overall production and supply chain of the industry. Hence, these are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of adhesives & sealants. On the other hand, the other various negative impact of adhesives and sealants on the environment, which is further expected to impede the industry’s growth. The presence of volatile organic compounds in these chemicals is the most harmful factor since these VOCs easily evaporate into the atmosphere, causing severe air pollution and also resulting in the formation of smog in the air, and respiratory issues in humans. Moreover, they can also contain hazardous secondary chemicals, such as isocyanide, formaldehyde, and heavy metals.  Improper waste management of these substances can severely impact the environment. 

By resin type, the global adhesives & sealants market is segmented into silicone, polyurethane, plastisol, polysulphide, butyl, and emulsion. The polyurethane segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is expected on account of the versatility of the polyurethane resin. These resins are highly compatible with different sorts of substrates, such as metals, plastics, composites, and glass. Thus, increasing its area of application in various industries, including construction, electronics, aerospace, and automotive. Furthermore, on the basis of technology, the market is further fragmented into hot-melt, reactive, water-based, and solvent-based. Amongst all, the hot-melt segment will dominate the market growth. By application, the construction sector is likely to grow significantly in comparison to the packaging, transportation, medical, footwear, and leather industry.
