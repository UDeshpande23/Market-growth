**Growing Admission of Patients in ICU to Promote Global Market Share of Nasogastric Tube**

The global nasogastric tube market is slated to grow majorly on account of the rising demand for ICUs from critical patients and higher cases of chronic diseases. People hospitalized in the ICU are in critical condition and have difficulty swallowing medications. These medications are administered via a nasogastric tube. Some patients acquire pneumonia during the course of COVID-19, with typical abnormalities on chest CT. This resulted in significant breathing issues, food swallowing, and other issues. Patients with severe symptoms are transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where mechanical ventilation is frequently required. The covid patients' preexisting chronic conditions exacerbated their situation. Moreover, nasogastric tubes can be used to drain excess fluid or prevent aspiration in some chronic diseases, such as pancreatic disorders or ailments with significant fluid accumulation in the belly. According to the World Health Organization, noncommunicable illnesses kill over 41 million people each year. 17 million of whom die before the age of 70.

Besides this, the market growth is also attributed to growing cases of surgical procedures followed by increasing demand for enteral feeding. A nasogastric tube is introduced during surgery to remove accumulated air, fluid, or gastrointestinal contents from the stomach. Furthermore, the body is too weak to absorb and swallow solid foods when recovering after surgery. Enteral feeding is thus employed to give appropriate therapeutic nutrition. Moreover, nasogastric tubes are a reasonably easy and non-invasive technique of enteral feeding in the intensive care unit. They are a temporary solution that is easy to implement.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global nasogastric tube market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surging Demand for Enteral Feeding
- Rising Cases of ICU Admissions and Surgery

**Challenges:**
There are various different methods that can be used for enteral feeding and there are no proper reimbursement policies for the manufacturers of nasogastric tubes are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of nasogastric tube. There are alternative methods for enteral feedings, such as gastronomy tubes, or jejunostomy tubes, which may be preferred over nasogastric tubes in certain patient populations. On the other hand, the infection caused by these tubes is also expected to stifle market expansion. Infections such as bloodstream infections and pneumonia might be increased by improper insertion, inadequate care, or prolonged use of the tube. These all problem cause discomfort and irritation for patients.


On the basis of tubes, the global nasogastric tube market is segmented into levin catheter, dobhoff tube, sengstaken-blakemore tube. The Levin catheter segment is to accumulate the maximum revenue through 2035, by growing at a significant CAGR in the upcoming years. The Levin catheter is becoming highly popular, owing to better health services provided at hospitals, which aids the treatment of the situation that increases the need for nasogastric tubes. Moreover, by patient group, the market is fragmented into geriatric and adults, the geriatric segment will grow significantly owing growing population of old adults. Older people have difficulty ingesting appropriate nutrients orally for a variety of reasons, including weak appetites and medical issues. Nasogastric tubes aid in their hydration and nutritional maintenance.

Moreover, by late June/early July 2020, overall non-COVID-19 admissions in the United States had grown to 16 percent of pre-pandemic baseline volume. Furthermore, the regulatory guidelines will promote the manufacturing of better and high-quality products, which will aid in market growth.
