**Growing Concern for the Prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases and Diabetes to Promote Global Market Share of Immunoprotein Diagnostic Testing**  

The global immunoprotein diagnostic testing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased concern for the prevalence of non-communicable diseases and diabetes. The increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases and diabetes all across the globe is raising the demand for immunoprotein diagnostic testing as it plays a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of these health issues. Additionally, according to data from the WHO's Global Health Observatory, up to 39.5 million deaths worldwide in 2017 were attributed to non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as diabetes, cancer, chronic lung diseases, and cardiovascular illnesses.

By indication, the global immunoprotein diagnostic testing market is segmented into chemiluminescence assay, immunofluorescence assay, immunoturbidity assay, immunoprotein electrophoresis, enzyme-based immunoassay. The immunoprotein electrophoresis segment is to garner a substantial revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. It is because of the availability of this test that allows a proper analysis of protein levels, i.e. to determine whether or not proteins are increasing or decreasing as a consequence of chronic diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer which may have resulted in these growths. In particular, it contributes to the measurement of various immunoglobulin types in a patient's blood.

By region, the Europe immunoprotein diagnostic testing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by growing presence of diabetes and cancer among European population. One of the factors that has contributed to growth in this area is an increasing number of government initiatives undertaken in Germany aimed at testing people with multifactorial and chronic diseases, most notably detection of cancer, diabetes, lung or cardiovascular disease.
