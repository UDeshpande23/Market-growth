The global** concrete cooling market is estimated to grow on the back of increasing demand for concrete cooling in industrial sector. Hot concrete can cause problems, such as, unequal concrete density, low tensile strength and durability, and higher water evaporation rate. To avoid these setbacks, concrete cooling is being adopted, which is estimated to boost the market growth.

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global concrete cooling market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in Asia Pacific region is expected to provide maximum growth opportunities owing to the growing construction activities, baked by economic development in the region. As per the data by the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), the ministry of Road Transport and Highways is allocated a budget of USD 14.85 billion in 2021-25, for the construction of bridges and highways. The market in the middle east is estimated to grow significantly throughout the forecast period, owing to the high temperature in this region, which increases demand for concrete cooling systems.

**Increasing Demand for Concrete Cooling in Industrial Application to Boost the Market Growth**

Industrial construction involves large pour of concrete, for which, temperature of the concrete plays an important role. If the concrete is too hot, it will dry unequally, and water will evaporate quickly, leaving unequal density in the structure. To avoid this, concrete cooling is used in industrial sector, which is estimated to boost the market growth.
