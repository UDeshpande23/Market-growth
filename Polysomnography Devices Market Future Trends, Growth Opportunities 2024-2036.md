**Growing Cases of Obesity to Promote Global Market Share of Polysomnography Devices**

The global polysomnography devices market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing number of individuals with obesity. Over the past three decades, obesity rates have been rising gradually on a global scale which has also raised the risk of numerous health issues. For instance, researchers have discovered that the prevalence of adult overweight and obesity has risen by more than 27% globally over the previous 33 years. Moreover, obesity is a serious public health issue with a high and growing prevalence which can lead to sleep disturbances, and sleep disorders.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global polysomnography devices market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Awareness Regarding Sleep Issues Globally
- Rising Cases of Respiratory Conditions

**Challenges:**

The high cost of polysomnography devices and the lack of education about sleep disorders among individuals and medical professionals are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of polysomnography devices. Polysomnography equipment can be costly in some areas which may result in a growing interest in alternative methods such as questionnaires and portable sleep test equipment that can provide a quick and effective fix for sleep difficulties.

By type, the global polysomnography devices market is segmented into fixed and portable. The fixed segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. OSA, or obstructive sleep apnea is a common chronic sleep-related breathing problem that can result from more than 95 chronic lung conditions, the majority of which result in lung tissue scarring that worsens with time. Moreover, persistent exposure to dangerous substances, including asbestos, can result in interstitial lung disease that is frequently accompanied by exhaustion, a dry cough, chest pain, and weight loss. Individuals suffering from interstitial lung disease (ILD) often experience dyspnea, dyspnea, coughing, disturbances in their regular sleep patterns, and more fragmented sleep on polysomnography. Patients with ILD have been found to have a significant prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in recent research which could lead to a lower standard of living.

These factors necessitate the use of fixed polysomnography equipment that utilizes several sensors, to let doctors notice irregularities during the course of a whole night's sleep and adjust the course of treatment accordingly. In addition, portable polysomnography devices yield more precise findings when used in a laboratory due to its ability to be customized.

By region, the Europe polysomnography devices market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by a higher number of senior people in the region. Europe leads the world in the percentage of elderly population due to low fertility rates observed in all EU nations, along with high net migration inflows and life expectancy at birth. For instance, in 2022, more than 21 % of the EU population was aged 65 and over. Particularly, with over 23% of the overall population 65 years of age and older, Italy has the highest proportion of elderly people in all of Europe followed by Portugal, Finland, and Greece. Lately, more than 24% of Europeans are 65 years of age or older and this figure is expected to reach over 28% by 2050. Moreover, the elderly population in Europe has a high prevalence of sleep disorders like insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and REM sleep therefore it is necessary to raise awareness of the significance of sleep for health.

Additionally, more than 9% of adult Europeans suffer from insomnia, making it a relatively prevalent illness characterized by impairments to everyday functioning, and is linked to significant health issues like diabetes, heart disease, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.
