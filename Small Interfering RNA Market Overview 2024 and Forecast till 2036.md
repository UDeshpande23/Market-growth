**Small Interfering RNA Market Overview 2024 and Forecast till 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Small Interfering RNA Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/small-interfering-rna-market/5297): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global small interfering RNA market in terms of market segmentation by type, end-user, indication and by region. 

**Growing Cases of Neurodegenerative Disorders to Promote Global Market Share of Small Interfering RNA**

The global small interfering RNA market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. The prevalence and incidence of these diseases rise rapidly with age, owing to exposure to environmental pollutants, bad lifestyle habits, vascular problems, and newly recognized risk factors such as hearing loss. Moreover, the use of siRNA-based drug delivery as a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases is a viable avenue for the development of novel therapeutic techniques.

According to estimates, neurological illnesses are the primary cause of physical and cognitive disability worldwide, which impact over 12% of the global population.

The global small interfering RNA market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing trend of personalized medicines. Personalized medicine is a new medical practice that makes use of a person's genetic profile holds great promise for disease treatment and prevention, and represents an exciting opportunity to improve the future of individualized healthcare for all citizens. SiRNA therapy, commonly known as gene-silencers, is a type of personalized medicine that has emerged as a promising strategy for personalized cancer and other illness treatments.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global small interfering RNA market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Drug Development
- Rising Elderly Population Globally

**Challenges:**

The exorbitant cost of small interfering RNA and the stringent regulations developed by the government of nations for the approval of small interfering RNA therapies worldwide are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of small interfering RNA. Multiple clinical trials are conducted before bringing small interfering RNA therapies to the market. These trials are often expensive, which adds to the overall cost of the therapy. Besides this, the development of siRNA therapies involves extensive research & development that leads to higher costs.

By type, the global small interfering RNA market is segmented into liposome based systemic therapy, and nanoparticle based systemic therapy. The nanoparticle-based systemic therapy segment is to garner a notable revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The employment of nanoparticles for siRNA administration enhanced pharmacokinetics and is known to be more durable and stable Nano carriers than lipid Nanocarriers. For instance, various types of AuNPs have recently been extensively researched for siRNA delivery including gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) owing to their good biocompatibility, and ease of synthesis. Additionally, Patisiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) lipid nanoparticle-based medication, is currently the most advanced RNAi therapeutic approved by the FDA.

By region, the Europe small interfering RNA market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2036. This growth is anticipated by growing product approvals in the region. For instance, Novartis received EU clearance for Leqvio, the first and only licensed small-interfering RNA (siRNA) LDL-C lowering medication in Europe. Furthermore, Leqvio produced an effective reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of more than 50% in patients and is predicted to support long-term adherence with two doses per year. 

Besides this, the growing elderly population in European region may create a huge demand for small interfering RNA in the coming years. For instance, more than 20% of the EU population will be 65 or older in 2022. Moreover, one in every five Europeans is now 65 or older, and by 2050, it will be close to more than 25%. The elderly population is more likely to get affected by various age-related diseases including arthritis, and other neurodegenerative diseases, which may drive the demand for siRNA in the region.
