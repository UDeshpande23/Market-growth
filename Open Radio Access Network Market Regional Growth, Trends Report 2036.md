Furthermore, the commercial deployment of the next generation 5G network will allow mobile operators to offer a wide range of networking solutions that are intended to support the 5G network. Advanced networking solutions are needed to ensure high reliability of the 5G network, as it is equipped with higher speed and bandwidth capacities. To develop innovative radio access network solutions to support fifth generation technologies, the major technology solution providers are strategically working with other technology companies.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global open radio access network market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- The uptake of 5G technologies in the wireless network is increasing.
- Lower upfront deployment cost 

**Challenges:**

Complexities in integrating systems and network reliability are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of open radio access network.

By component, the global open radio access network market is segmented into hardware, software, and services. Out of these, the hardware segment is anticipated to hold the largest market share throughout the forecast period. On the contrary software segment is expected to grow with the highest CAGR of 89.5% over the forecast period. More hardware availability was provided in 2021 because there are no ORAN interfaces for 3GPP, making it necessary to support the 7.2 splits. In order to maintain vendor diversity and interoperability in the coming years, a requirement that vendors support split 7.2 will allow users to mix and match RUs with CU or DU software installed on an x86 server.
