Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global synthetic rubber market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Healthcare & Medical Device Industry demand synthetic rubber for manufacturing surgical gloves, condoms, breathing bags, stoppers, cushioning materials, tubes, and other medical essentials
- Growing demand for rubber products in the automotive and construction industries

**Challenges:**

Synthetic rubber's global market size is anticipated to be affected by concerns about the impact on the environment. Synthetic rubber production results in the release of volatile organic compounds and other hazardous air pollutants, which have a detrimental effect on the environment. Additionally, the production of synthetic rubber also involves the use of non-renewable resources, which can further damage the environment.

Synthetic rubber is classified by application into automotive (tires and non-tires), footwear, textile, industrial products, consumer goods, and others. By 2035, the automotive segment is expected to generate the highest 48% revenues, growing at a significant CAGR. As a result of the growing automotive industry, which is producing a growing number of vehicles as well as increasing the demand for tires, clutches, and engine bearings, along with the increasing investments in the development of lightweight vehicles to improve fuel economy, the segment has grown rapidly. It was observed that the production of motor vehicles worldwide increased by 1.3% from 2020 to 79 million in 2021.
