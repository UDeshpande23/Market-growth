Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global ground surveillance radar (GSR) systems market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Marine Industry Globally
- Rising Technological Advancements

**Challenges:**

The high cost of GSR systems and the increasing cyber ware fare are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of ground surveillance radar (GSR) systems. One of the key elements projected to impede the market's growth is the cost of GSR systems. For instance, ground surveillance radar system design, development, and testing demand significant research and development efforts. This can be a time-consuming, expensive process that necessitates specialized skills, materials, and equipment.

By application, the global ground surveillance radar (GSR) systems market is segmented into home security, aerospace & defense, critical infrastructure, and others. The aerospace & defense segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to growing investment in the aerospace and defense sector around the world. For instance, aerospace and defense companies may decide to invest in the creation of cutting-edge ground surveillance radar systems to enhance their monitoring and intelligence capabilities and respond to new security threats. Moreover, ground surveillance radar systems are essential for aerospace and defense operations since they are used for a variety of functions, such as spotting and tracking enemy movements and providing situational awareness to military personnel. The total amount spent on militaries worldwide increased by more than 0.5% in 2021. The top five spenders in 2021, which together accounted for more than 60% of expenditures, were the US, China, India, the UK, and Russia.
