Technologies that can be used to obtain passwords, secret questions, and passwords generated using tokens are now easily accessible to cybercriminals. Robust exploits such as this continue to hinder the widespread use of sophisticated analytics in industries that rely heavily on data. 

Furthermore, complexity of the data ecosystems and high initial costs are some of the challenging factors that may hamper the growth of agreement analytics market.
