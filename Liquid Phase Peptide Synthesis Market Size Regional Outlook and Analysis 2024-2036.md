The global liquid phase peptide synthesis market is projected to grow with a moderate CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2022-2030, on account of the increased adoption of liquid phase peptide synthesis by large-scale industries and the growth in the use of peptides in pharmaceutical drug development, mainly for lifestyle-related disorders. According to the International Diabetes Federation, it is estimated that around 463 million people globally had diabetes in 2019, and by 2045, the number is projected to reach 700 million. The advancement in research has allowed healthcare providers to make use of peptides in treating various metabolic conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Moreover, liquid phase peptide synthesis is the most commonly used method for the generation of larger peptides needed in large-scale industries along with making vaccines, which is projected to contribute to the market growth. The vaccines developed using peptides are highly stable and generally water-soluble. These factors are expected to contribute significantly to the liquid phase peptide synthesis market growth. 

The market is segmented by product into reagents, equipment, solvents, and others. Among these segments, the equipment segment is anticipated to hold the largest share in terms of revenue by the end of 2030, as a result of the higher rates of adoption of these instruments for the liquid phase peptide synthesis. On the basis of end-user, the market is segmented into pharmaceutical & biotechnology industry, contract development & manufacturing organizations, academic & research institutes, and others, out of which, the pharmaceutical & biotechnology industry segment is expected to witness notable growth over the forecast period owing to the progress in use of peptides for therapeutic development.

On the basis of region, the market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa, out of which, the liquid phase peptide synthesis market in the Asia Pacific region is projected to grow at the highest CAGR throughout the forecast period owing to the increasing demand for new antibody and protein-based drugs in the region. Currently, the market in North America holds the largest share. This can be attributed to the presence of well-developed healthcare infrastructure in the region, especially in the United States, along with the favorable regulations for peptide drug approval in the region. 

**Growth in Use of Peptides in Pharmaceutical Drug Development to Drive Market Growth**

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), between 2015 and 2019, authorization for use was provided to a total of 208 new drugs, out of which 15 were peptides or peptide-containing molecules. This accounts for 7% of the total number of authorized drugs.

Peptides are used in a varied range of therapeutics, owing to their diverse biological functions. They are progressively being used as potential active pharmaceutical agents for drug development. Moreover, the increased adoption of liquid phase peptide synthesis by large-scale industries in recent years for the generation of high-quality peptides is also expected to boost the market growth in upcoming years. 

However, the slow peptide production speed along with high labour requirement for liquid phase peptide synthesis and distributed nature of regulations for therapeutic peptides are some of the factors that are estimated to restrain market growth in the near future.
