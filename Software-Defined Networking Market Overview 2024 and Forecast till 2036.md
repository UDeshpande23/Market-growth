**Software-Defined Networking Market Overview 2024 and Forecast till 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Software-Defined Networking Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/software-defined-networking-sdn-market/4980): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitor’s analysis and a detailed overview of the global software-defined networking market in terms of market segmentation by model, end-user, and by region. 

**Growing Adoption of Network Virtualization to Promote Global Market Share of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**

The global software-defined networking market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the growing need to optimize network resources and quickly adapt networks to changing business needs, applications, and traffic. Software-defined networking has become one of the most promising and lucrative networking technologies capable of enabling virtualization and innovation of the network, addressing most of the ongoing networking issues, and has had a major effect on the management of IT infrastructure and network design. It also promotes efficient network traffic decision-making for network operators and offers centralized network control. Moreover, the rising investments in software-defined networking function virtualization are expected to reduce the capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) of most enterprises.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global software-defined networking market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rise in Investment in Advance Networking Technologies by Communication Services Providers
- Increasing Network Traffic 

**Challenges:**

The rising security concern associated with the use of software-defined networking, and the reluctance in transitioning from traditional networks are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of software-defined networking. Security risks due to the centralized nature of the data plane can rarely be averted, and further factors such as legacy network equipment issues are also restraining the growth of the market during the forecast period.

By end-user, the global software-defined networking market is segmented into data centers, service providers, enterprises, and others. The data center segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Rise in the number of data centers worldwide. In 2022, the existence of over 8,000 data centers was registered worldwide. Data center service providers simplify and automate the provisioning of their networks for end-to-end network and service management and control with the help of software-defined networking. SDN controllers are considered a critical part of a data center software-defined network. In a software-defined data center, all elements of the infrastructure viz, networking, storage, CPU, and security are virtualized and delivered as a service, the entire provisioning and operation of the infrastructure are driven by software, hence their expansion is also anticipated to boost the segment growth.
