The global robotic process automation market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing usage of intelligent bots. Businesses often use chatbots and other intelligent bots to enhance the client experience and also to handle consumers and provide 24/7 service. As a result, the market for robotic process automation is projected to expand. As of 2022, more than 50% of organizations that used artificial intelligence had chatbots in their IT departments.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global robotic process automation market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

· Surge in Knowledge about Cloud Computing

· Rising Usage of RPA in Diverse Applications

**Challenges:**

The hesitance to implement automated processes and the challenge associated with automating non-standard processes are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of robotic process automation. The conversion of the manual process into an automated process is projected to cost a lot of money as no one's labor is able to absorb new technology, they are reluctant to incorporate them into their processes. Additionally, as technology advances, automated procedures change continuously, making it difficult to adjust. As a result, it is anticipated to slow the expansion of the worldwide robotic process automation market.

By industry, the global robotic process automation market is segmented into finance, retail, healthcare, BFSI, manufacturing, it & telecom, and others. The BFSI segment is estimated to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The reason behind the growth can be attributed to the increasing need to automate financial institutions' business procedures, such as deposits and account opening, in order to eliminate errors. Additionally, RPA use has increased significantly in BFSI organizations, and the requirement to automate company processes in order to boost productivity and efficiency is anticipated to further accelerate the segment's growth in the market. According to estimates, over 60% of financial organizations worldwide have already piloted or are now implementing robotic process automation.
