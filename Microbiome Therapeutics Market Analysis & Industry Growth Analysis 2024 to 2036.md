Microbiome therapeutics deals with restoring healthy microorganisms back to the human body. The human body consists of several types of microorganisms which are known for balancing human health. With the increasing consumption of certain type of drugs, such as antibiotics, and others, the number of beneficial microorganisms in the human body is reducing, which is raising the concern amongst individuals for gut health. Moreover, increasing prevalence of different types of diseases and the increasing age of individuals worldwide, coupled with the unhealthy lifestyle patterns, are some of the factors anticipated to contribute towards the growth of the global microbiome therapeutics market during the forecast period. The global microbiome therapeutics market is anticipated to grow with a notable CAGR during the forecast period, i.e., 2023-2035. 

The market is segmented by application into diabetes, Crohn’s disease, clostridium difficile infection (CDI), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and others, out of which, the diabetes segment is anticipated to hold the largest share by the end of 2035. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the increasing research and developments that finds significant correlation between bacterial genes with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the increasing prevalence of diabetes globally is also anticipated to drive the growth of the segment during the forecast period. In the United States, around 10.5% of its population had diabetes in the year 2018.

Geographically, the global microbiome therapeutics market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa regions. Among these regions, the market in North America is anticipated to hold the largest market share during the forecast period owing to the rising healthcare expenditure in the region, along with the presence of numerous key players who are operating in the microbiome therapeutics market. Moreover, presence of numerous established research facilities, along with the presence of a conscious population who are highly aware for good health are some of the factors anticipated to drive the growth of the market in the region.

**Increasing Number of Collaborations, along with Increasing Investments for Research to Drive the Market Growth**

Organizations operating in the microbiome therapeutics market are increasingly collaborating with other healthcare operators for the development of microbiome-based therapeutics, which is anticipated to drive the market growth during the forecast period. Additionally, governmental organizations are too supporting these research initiatives by supplementing it with a significant share of their nation’s GDP.
