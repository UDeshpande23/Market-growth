**Power Transmission Gearbox Market Size, Share and Forecast 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Power Transmission Gearbox Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/power-transmission-gearbox-market/5323): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global power transmission gearbox market in terms of market segmentation by transmission type, products, stage, material, end user, and by region. 

**Growing Manufacturing Industry to Promote Global Market Share of Power Transmission Gearbox**

The global power transmission gearbox market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising manufacturing output from several industries. This will increase the demand for heavy machinery and equipment, which indirectly increase the demand for power transmission gearbox. According to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, in the second quarter of 2021, industrialized countries reported yearly output growth of 19.2 per cent. Moreover, regionally, the US manufacturing industry performed well last year, with the Americas growth rate reaching 6.9% in 2022, up from 3.3% in 2021. The power transmission gearbox facilitation the transmission of energy and smooth the running of the machines.

Besides this, the rising demand for power is also expected to drive the market growth of power transmission gearbox. Building energy demand is expected to climb by 15% by 2050. The average global household power demand will rise by 75% between 2021 and 2050, driven by the increasing economies of developing countries. This will also increase the line for successful power transmission and distribution in the world, hence contributing to the market growth of power transmission gearboxes.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global power transmission gearbox market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Demand for Electricity
- Higher Development of Energy Efficient Machines

**Challenges:**

Hydraulic transmission, direct drives, and variable frequency drives are some of the direct competitors of power transmission gearbox and hence hamper the expansion of the market, Moreover, the advent of electric vehicles will reduce the usage of power transmission gearboxes also hampers the global market size of power transmission gearbox. Electric vehicle mainly relies on direct drive systems, which directly connects to motos, hence further restricting the market growth.

By end user, the global power transmission gearbox market is segmented into energy, automotive, mining, aerospace, marine, and chemical. The automotive segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The rising production of energy-efficient automotives is expected to drive the growth of the segment.

The market in Europe, amongst the market in all the other regions, is projected to hold a majority of the share by the end of 2036. The growth of the market can be attributed majorly to the number of businesses engaged in chemical, machinery, automotive, and food processing. All these sectors rely heavily on heavy machinery and equipment and thus increase the need for transmitting power through power transmission gearboxes. Furthermore, the growing emphasis of industries on automation and the adoption of digital technology, such as IoT, and robotics is further expected to boost the demand for power transmission gearboxes.
