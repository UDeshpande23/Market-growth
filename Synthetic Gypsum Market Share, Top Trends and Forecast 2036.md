The use of synthetic gypsum helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving natural resources. Additionally, the growing construction activities, particularly in developing countries, have boosted the demand for synthetic gypsum. Over the years, a number of countries have been investing in testing, process design, and the use of state-of-the-art gypsum processing equipment. Several players in the synthetic gypsum market are adding value-added products to end users. The increased adoption of gypsum boards among construction companies owing to the ease of installation, fire resistance, and non-toxicity is also influencing the market. The gypsum-board face paper is gaining popularity as the recycling processes have also improved especially in developed nations. 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Environmental Regulations
- Increasing Agricultural Benefits

**Challenges:**

Synthetic gypsum faces competition from other substitutes or alternative materials, such as natural gypsum, phosphogypsum, and industrial byproducts like fly ash. These materials may be readily available or have cost advantages in specific regions, which can impact the demand and market penetration of synthetic gypsum. The synthetic gypsum industry must adhere to various environmental and regulatory standards related to waste disposal, emissions, and product quality.

By application, the global synthetic gypsum market is segmented into construction materials and agriculture. The agriculture segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is attributed to soil improvement and nutrient management. Synthetic gypsum is used as a soil amendment to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability. It improves the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of soil, helping retain essential nutrients and preventing leaching, thus promoting better nutrient management.

By region, the synthetic gypsum market in the Europe region, amongst the market in all the other regions, is projected to hold a majority of the share by the end of 2035. The growth of the market can be owed to stringent environmental regulations. Europe has implemented strict environmental regulations aimed at reducing emissions and promoting sustainable practices, leading to the increased adoption of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems and the production of synthetic gypsum. Ongoing infrastructure development projects, as well as renovation and modernization activities, have contributed to the demand for construction materials like synthetic gypsum in Europe.
