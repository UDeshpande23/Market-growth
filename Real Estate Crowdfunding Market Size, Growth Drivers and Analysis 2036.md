The concept of crowdfunding in the real estate industry took a massive leap post the implementation of the jumpstart our business startups (JOBS) act of 2012. Prior to the implementation of this act, investors could have only invested in physical properties or in real estate investment trusts (REITs). Moreover, with the increasing influence of globalization, the number of commercial real estate activities grew significantly, therefore raising the need amongst real estate companies to allocate funds to continue running their projects. As a result, real estate crowdfunding companies increasingly adopted IT technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, machine learning and others, for sourcing funds for their projects. Such factors are therefore anticipated to drive the growth of the global real estate crowdfunding market in the coming years.

The global real estate crowdfunding market registered is anticipated to grow with a CAGR of 50.6% during the forecast period, i.e., 2024-2036. Increasing favorable regulations of government of nations worldwide for crowdfunding in the real estate sector, coupled with the rising number of real estate activities are some of the factors anticipated to contribute to the market growth during the forecast period.

The market is segmented by investors into institutional investors and individual or retail investors. Out of these segments, the institutional investors segment is projected to hold the highest market share by the end of 2028. The growth of the segment can be attributed to the benefits gained by the real estate crowdfunding platforms by sourcing large-scaled investments from the institutional investors, such as life insurance companies and pension funds.
