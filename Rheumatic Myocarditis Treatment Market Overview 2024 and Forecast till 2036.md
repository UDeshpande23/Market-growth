Rheumatic fever is caused by bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus), which can adversely affect the heart valves, if left untreated.

Government is taking various steps to curb and control the spread of this bacteria, as rheumatic myocarditis is deadly. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), rheumatic myocarditis is causes over 288,348 deaths each year. Moreover, increasing research and development activities to develop new drugs and other treatment solutions, is estimated to further boost the market growth.
