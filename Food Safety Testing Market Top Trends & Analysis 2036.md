**Growing Prevalence of Foodborne Illness and Allergies to Drive Growth of Global Food Safety Testing Market**

The global food safety testing market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased cases of food-borne diseases all across the world. The World Health Organization estimates that each year 420 000 people worldwide pass away and 600 million become unwell as a result of eating rotten food, leaving 33 million years of the good life. Moreover, 125 000 deaths from foodborne illness occur each year in children under the age of five, accounting for 40% of all foodborne disease mortality. Furthermore, China saw a total of about 7,000 foodborne outbreaks in 2020, which resulted in close to 37,000 illnesses and 143 fatalities. Food testing lowers the chance of contracting a foodborne illness and its associated risks.

Moreover, globally, food allergies are on the rise and can be extremely harmful, if not lethal. Food safety testing is crucial for locating allergens in products as well as for lengthening the shelf life of finished goods to prevent pathogen attacks. Regardless of the impact of the food, it is estimated that one in four people is to have a food allergy and eventually experience a significant reaction. In addition, from around 1,015 admissions in 2013 to over 1,746 admissions in 2019, the hospital admission of children suffering from food allergies increased in England. In addition to this, there will be around 20 million Americans with food allergies by 2021, of which 16 million will be adults and the remaining 4% will be youngsters. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global food safety testing market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in the Consumption of Processed Food
- Rising Advancement of Food Testing Technologies

**Challenges:**

Lack of technical experience in small businesses and the high cost of food safety equipment and its upkeep are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the growth of the global food safety testing market. A lack of technical support may seriously contaminate food and beverage items and jeopardize the testing and analysis of food operations. It is especially true for small businesses; they lack sufficient knowledge about cutting-edge testing techniques and new safety procedures. As a result, they don't meet the requirements for food safety. On the other hand, insufficient infrastructure for food testing is also expected to impede market growth. For the sake of people's health, it is essential that food safety testing be carried out in qualified labs that are furnished with standard laboratory apparatus. Also, these labs must be kept very clean in order to produce accurate results for food testing. Many food testing facilities lack the essential infrastructure, sufficient water, better equipment, and standardized testing procedures. 

By application, the global food safety testing market is segmented into dairy products, bakery & confectionery, processed & packages food, infant food, functional food, meat & poultry products, alcoholic & non-alcoholic beverages, and seafood. The meat & poultry products segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The increase in meat and poultry production is the major driving force for the segment's expansion. In America and China, increased productivity per animal is expected to increase the production of meat and poultry. Additionally, in 2021, there were 87 million more eggs produced than in 2021. Since 1990, the number of eggs produced worldwide has increased by more than 100%. Moreover, the OECD-FAO Agriculture estimate stated that by 2030, the world's beef supply will likely reach 374 Mt. Meat and poultry have the potential to be harmful if improperly handled, food safety testing is crucial for these items.

By region, the Europe food safety testing market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. A rise in market size in Europe is anticipated owing to the rising demand for seafood. Europeans consume 24 kilograms of fish or seafood on average per year, which is about 3.3 kilograms more than the rest of the world. In addition, cod, tuna, and salmon are the most popular seafood dishes. Moreover, a sizable portion of seafood is consumed by Europeans as a source of protein in their diet. On the other hand, the market growth is also attributed to the rising production and consumption of milk. According to Eurostat, the average apparent milk yield per cow in the EU was 7,682 kg in 2021. Additionally, in 2021, the European Union produced 161 million tons of raw milk.
