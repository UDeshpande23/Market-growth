Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global oxygen free copper market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in Number of Innovative Product Launches
- Rising Need in Electronic Sector 

**Challenges:**

The oxygen free copper production necessitates a highly specialized refining process to remove oxygen and other impurities, leading to a significantly higher cost compared to standard copper. This can limit adoption in cost-sensitive applications. Furthermore, geopolitical instability and competition from alternatives are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of oxygen free copper.

By product form, the global oxygen free copper market is segmented into wires, strips, rods, bars, pipes, sheets. The strip segment is to garner a notable revenue of USD 8.1 billion by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Oxygen free copper strips are one of the most widely used solutions for electrical and electronic components. These strips are highly conductive, have low contact resistance, and have great formability at a wide temperature range. The use of oxygen-less copper strips for motor windings, connectors, and shielded power cables among other applications due to their higher tensile strength and resistance to corrosion is also used.

By region, the North America oxygen free copper market is to generate a significant revenue of USD 11.32 billion by the end of 2035. The growth of the regional market is influenced by the regulatory framework related to the manufacturing of oxygen-free copper products. Such as, the ASTM B170-99 standard applies to Class 1 and Class 2 oxygen-free electrolytic wires made from copper rods, billets, and cakes without the use of metal or metalloid deoxidizers. The chemical composition of each variety must comply with the stated specifications. The highest possible mass resistance for classes 1 and 2 is displayed. According to test method d of test method B 577, quality class 1 must withstand 10 bends before failure. According to Test Method D of Test Method B 577, Class 2 must withstand eight reverse bends without failure. As a result, regulations impact market growth.
