**String Inverter Market Size: Regional Outlook and Analysis 2024-2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[String Inverter Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/string-inverter-market/4986): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global string inverter market in terms of market segmentation by connection type, phase, end users, and by region. 

**Growing Production of Renewable Energy to Promote Global Market Share of String Inverter**

The global string inverter market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the rising installation of solar panels and the rising demand and production of renewable energy. String inverters play a crucial role in renewable energy systems, especially in solar PV installations. Solar panels generate DC electricity when sunlight is flashed on them. However, most of the appliances work on AC electricity. String inverters convert the DC power produced by a series of solar panels into AC power to make solar energy compatible with electrical systems. The global power capacity from renewables is projected to rise by 2400 GW between the years 2022 and 2027. Moreover, the world had installed enough solar panels as of March 2022 to generate around 1 TW of direct solar power.

Besides this, the advanced features of string inverters and rising initiatives are taken for providing electricity in the rural region. String inverters are frequently equipped with advanced monitoring and control capabilities, as well as the ability to extract real-time data. This data may be utilized to take decisions associated with system updates and maintenance, which improves the smart infrastructure overall. Furthermore, the Indian government has passed the provision of power to approximately 18,000 villages and set a goal of installing 175 GW of renewable energy

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global string inverter market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surging Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies
- Higher Deployment of Solar Panels

**Challenges:**

Loss of heat from the components of a string inverter is going to impede market growth. All types of string inverters lose some heat and this impacts the performance and life of these inverters. On the other hand, the regulation policies for exporting inverters keep on changing which makes manufacturers adhere to these policies. In addition to this, string inverters are highly susceptible to performance degradation when part of the solar panels in a string is shaded. These are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of string inverter.

The string inverter market is segmented by phase, connection type, and by end users. By phase, the market is further fragmented into single phase, and three phases. Out of which, the three-phase segment is expected to dominate the market growth. Owing to the higher power capacity and improved efficiency, string inverters are commonly used in industrial and commercial applications. Three phase system is highly used in the commercial sector, to balance the power distribution across the sector, the three phases required a string inverter. Moreover, by connection type, the global string inverter market is segmented into off-grid and on-grid. The off-grid segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. Rising off-grid solar panel electricity generation will drive segment expansion. The off-grid solar industry is growing, with 70 million more people gaining access to electricity through off-grid solar power since 2019.

By region, the North American string inverter market is to hold the second-largest share by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by the rising demand for renewable energy. The string inverter is used to convert the direct current from renewable energy sources to alternating current, therefore higher production of renewable energy, such as solar energy will increase the need for string inverters. Moreover, there has been a presence of leading manufacturers of string inverters in the countries such as the United States, which is further predicted to contribute to the market’s growth in the region.
