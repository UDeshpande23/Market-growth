It is predicted that the entertainment and gaming segment will provide the highest revenue by the end of 2035, despite growing at a significant CAGR on account of the increasing demand for immersive gaming experiences as well as the growing trend of incorporating mixed reality elements into traditional gaming platforms. Additionally, the emergence of 5G networks and advanced hardware is making it possible for developers to create more sophisticated mixed-reality games that take advantage of the latest technologies.

By the end of 2035, the North American mixed reality market is expected to generate the most revenue. This growth is anticipated by the increasing demand for mixed reality products from multiple industries such as healthcare, retail, and entertainment.
