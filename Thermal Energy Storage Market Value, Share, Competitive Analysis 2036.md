**Thermal Energy Storage Market Value, Share, Competitive Analysis 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Thermal Energy Storage Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/thermal-energy-storage-market/4784): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global thermal energy storage market in terms of market segmentation by technology, storage material, application, end user and by region. 

**The Increasing Generation of Solar Energy Throughout the World promotes the Global Market Share of Thermal Energy Storage**

The global thermal energy storage market is estimated to grow majorly on account of a rise in the production of solar energy and the rapid installation of solar PV systems. By the end of 2020, the International Renewable Energy Agency predicts 710 GW of solar PV installations worldwide. Solar PV capacity increased by 125 GW in 2020, the most of any renewable energy source. Solar energy is intermittent, meaning it can't be stored for long periods. To make the most of this energy, thermal energy storage systems are used to capture the heat produced from solar energy and store it for later use. This drives the need for thermal energy storage systems and thus, the growth of the global thermal energy storage market.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global thermal energy storage market are: 

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing governmental initiatives to promote clean energy sources
- A growing number of investments are being made in the transition to clean energy

**Challenges:**

The global market size for thermal energy storage is expected to be hampered by container size limitations and thermal stability issues. The size of containers limits the amount of thermal energy that can be stored since larger containers are needed to store more energy. Moreover, thermal energy storage materials are often thermally unstable, meaning that heat generated from the stored energy can degrade them over time. In turn, this can lead to a decrease in efficiency and an increase in costs.

In terms of end users, the thermal energy storage market is segmented into residential, commercial & industrial, and utilities.  Revenues for the commercial & industrial segment are expected to grow at a significant CAGR through 2035 owing to the increasing demand for energy efficiency and lower operational costs in commercial and industrial establishments. In particular, the number of small and medium-sized businesses requiring power for their daily operations has increased significantly. Moreover, retail power sales to businesses rose by roughly 3% in 2021 due to an increase in energy demand for both industrial and commercial use. The power demand globally has grown by 3% since 2000.

North America is expected to generate the most revenue from thermal energy storage by the end of 2035. The growth is expected to be driven by majorly rising thermal energy usage along with an increase in heating and cooling systems for buildings in the region. The region has some of the most advanced heating and cooling technologies, as well as a large population that is increasingly looking to adopt sustainable energy solutions. In the US, buildings consume 39% of primary energy and 74% of electricity. In the United States, air conditioning, water heating, and refrigeration account for around 50% of building energy use, a figure expected to rise in the future.
