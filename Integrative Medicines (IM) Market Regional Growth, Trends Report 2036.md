The market is segmented by intervention into botanicals, body healing, mind healing, external energy, and sensory healing. Among these segments, the botanicals segment is anticipated to hold the largest share during the forecast period attributing to the increasing adoption of natural remedies such as Ayurveda and homeopathy worldwide.

**Increasing Ageing Population and Growing Adoption of Natural Therapies to Drive Market Growth**

According to the data collected from the United Nations, it is expected that by the year 2050, every one out of six individuals will be 65 years or older, which accounts for 16% of the total population of the world. Additionally, the number of individuals above 80 years or older is also expected to triple by the end of the year 2050.

Age is one of the most predominant risk factors for chronic and mental disorders. As the population of the globe is ageing at a rapid pace, the cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and others is also expected to rise.
