**Growing Prevalence of Infectious and Allergy Diseases to Promote Global Market Share of Vaccine Adjuvants**

The global vaccine adjuvants market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased presence of infectious and allergy diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other infectious disease along with the increasing demand for advanced and enhanced vaccines. NTDs include a diverse group of infectious diseases caused by parasites, bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other non-infectious agents. A vaccine adjuvant is a substance that enhances the effectiveness of a vaccine. The prevalence of infectious diseases has increased the demand for more effective vaccines, thus driving the research and development of new vaccine excipients. According to a World Bank report, there were 37.7 million people all over the globe living with HIV/AIDS in 2020 in which half of them were girls and women.

Vaccine adjuvants are used to boost the body's immune response against cancer cells, allowing the body to mount a stronger attack against cancer cells. This helps keep tumors from growing and even eliminates them. Therefore, the rising prevalence of cancer is expected to drive the market growth. As per the World Cancer Research Fund International, approximately 18.1 million cancer cases were seen in 2020 all over the world. Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer in men worldwide, accounting for 15.4% of all newly diagnosed patients in 2020. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global vaccine adjuvants market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in the Cases of Seasonal Influenza 
- Growing Number of Government Initiatives to Promote Vaccination and Support the Development of New Vaccines 

**Challenges:**

The long approval process of vaccine adjuvants can limit the market growth as this can delay the availability of vaccines and can even cause old vaccines out of the market. The lengthy approval process can be a difficult task for new companies to enter this market. Besides, the high cost of vaccine adjuvants is also estimated to limit the growth of the market in the forecast period. As not everyone can afford vaccine adjuvant.

By route of administration, the global vaccine adjuvants market is segmented into the intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral route, and others. The intramuscular segment is to garner the highest revenue by the end of 2035 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. The intramuscular route of administration is gaining popularity among the patient population as it provides a more sustained release of the vaccine, thereby improving vaccine efficacy. Studies show that 30-50% of intended intramuscular injections are successful, while the rest are unintentional subcutaneous injections. In addition, intramuscular injection is believed to be less painful than other routes of administration, making it more desirable for patients. These factors are expected to create many opportunities for the growth of this sector in the coming years. 

By region, the North American vaccine adjuvants market is to generate the highest revenue by the end of 2035. This growth is anticipated by a higher large-scale geriatric population and a rising prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, aids, diabetes, and heart disease. Vaccine adjuvants enhance the immune system's response to vaccines, resulting in a stronger and more effective response. Given the high recommendations for pediatric vaccines, the demand for vaccine adjuvants is expected to increase in North America. These factors are expected to drive the growth of the vaccine adjuvant market in the North American region. As per the statistics, in 2020, lung cancer caused almost 1.8 million deaths at the same time liver cancer caused 830 thousand deaths.
