The expanding market for elastomer infusion pumps in emerging economies is being driven by improved healthcare infrastructure, increased health expenditure and greater awareness of advanced medicine. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global elastomeric infusion pump market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing use of chemotherapy, analgesia and antibiotics.
- Growing Aging Population.

**Challenges:**

Regulatory concerns, possibility of inaccurate flow rates and lack of flexibility to change flowrate and fill volume, stringent regulations by government pertaining to the use of plastics are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of elastomeric infusion pumps.

By product type, the global elastomeric infusion pumps market is segregated into continuous-rate elastomeric pumps and variable rate elastomeric pumps. The market is expected to be dominated over the forecast period by both constant velocity elastomer pumps. In particular, this is due to the extra benefits that these pumps provide of conventional pumps, e.g. their ability to maintain a steady flow of medication delivered and lead to constant fluid concentration. In addition, these infusion pumps are able to be used in any environment that requires constant drug infusion therapy including the home and hospital. As per a estimation 80% of all hospital patients are receiving intravenous treatment.
