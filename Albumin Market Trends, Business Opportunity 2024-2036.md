**Albumin Market Trends, Business Opportunity 2024-2036**

Europe is expected to control a significant share of the market.  Improved understanding of the role of albumin in various conditions and the development of innovative therapies have increased the utilization of albumin in Europe. The advancements in medical technology and practices have expanded the application of albumins in healthcare. On the other hand, the rising prevalence of liver diseases, such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver failure are also anticipated to boost the market growth in the region.

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Albumin Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/albumin-market/5035): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2035”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global albumin market in terms of market segmentation by type, grade, application, and by region. 

**Rise in the Number of Heart Operation Performed in the World to Promote Global Market Share of Albumin**

The global albumin market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increasing prevalence of diseases, that affects human organs and requires the surgery. For instance, Patients undergoing cardiac surgery may incur severe blood loss, demanding the replacement of electrolytes and blood-related materials. Therefore, rise in the number of cardiac surgeries will drive the demand for albumins. Every year, roughly 2 million individuals worldwide receive open-heart surgery in order to treat various cardiovascular conditions. On the other hand, it is expected that in the coming few years, over 50 million adults in the world will be suffering from chronic liver disease, since it occurrence rate has increase from 4.5% to 9.5% in the world wide population. Albumin is employed as a component in the removal of excess fluid from the abdomen in liver illnesses.

Besides this, various development has taken place in albumin, which makes it suitable for treating or aiding the treatment of a wide range of diseases. For instance, some researchers have suggested in COVID-19 patients if albumin serum is injected at low levels. It helps identify patients who are at high risk of developing pneumonia or respiratory failure and patients who require longer stays at the hospital. Furthermore, the rising popularity of plant-based albumin has significant drive the industry’s expansion. Plant-based albumins enable adaptation and change in function. As a result, scientists are attempting to create novel plant-based albumins through genetic engineering or by optimizing natural sources.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global albumin market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Surge in the Cardiovascular Surgeries
- Rising Use of Albumins in the Research and Development of Drug Delivery Systems 

**Challenges:**

Many people have shown allergic reactions towards albumin and there are strict regulatory policies for approving the use of albumin are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of albumin. Individuals with known allergies to albumin or other proteins are more prone to experience allergic responses.
