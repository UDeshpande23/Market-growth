First introduced is a government-sponsored effort by Japan's National Composites Centre (NCC) to create carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP) technology for automotive applications. The core technology is a press-compacted discontinuous thermoplastic composite reinforced with carbon fiber. For instance, Toray Industries launched the TORAYCA T1100G-13C, a brand-new carbon fiber composite material, in 2021. It provides increased strength and weight reduction and is designed for use in aviation and other high-performance resin types.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global hybrid composites market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Growing Environmental Concerns Among the People
- Increasing Demand for Lightweight Materials 

**Challenges:**

The cost of the raw ingredients required to produce a hybrid composite makes the fabrication of subsequent components expensive. The production cost of hybrid composite goods is significantly influenced by the cycle time, which is directly connected to the length of time required for filling and curing. These elements can end up hurting the demand for hybrid composites. 

Due to issues with the supply chain and growing material prices, the market for hybrid composites may be unable to grow further. Regulations and safety requirements specific to their industry, particularly in the automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors, may apply to hybrid composites. The difficulty and expense of bringing hybrid composites to market will increase if more study and testing are necessary to meet specific requirements, such as impact resistance or fire resistance.

By fiber, the hybrid composites market is segmented into carbon/glass, carbon/aramid, metal/plastic, and wood/plastic. Among the four, carbon/glass category is poised to lead the market during the forecast period. The market is expanding as a result of rising demand from the marine, aerospace, and automotive sectors. Better qualities of carbon/glass composites include their lightweight, which lowers the weight of wind turbine blades and automobiles.
