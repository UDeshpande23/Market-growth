The global electric vehicle polymers market is anticipated to attain a CAGR of ~72% over the forecast period, i.e., 2023 – 2035. The market is segmented on the basis of component into synthetic rubber, natural rubber, and others. Out of these, the synthetic rubber segment is anticipated to hold the notable market share over the forecast period owing to the various advantages of synthetic rubber, including the high electricity and heat resistance. Moreover, synthetic rubber is produced at a lower cost, as compared to natural rubber, which estimated to boost the segment growth.

The global electric vehicle polymers market is estimated to grow on the back of increasing sales for electric vehicles, backed by growing demand for environment friendly vehicles. According to the data by the International Energy Agency (IEA), 2,008,024 battery-powered electric vehicles (BEV) were sold in 2020. Moreover, the need to reduce vehicle weight and cost, by replacing metal with polymers, is anticipated to boost the market growth.

On the basis of geographical analysis, the global electric vehicle polymers market is segmented into five major regions including North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East & Africa region. The market in the North America region is anticipated to gain the largest market share throughout the forecast period owing to the increasing adoption of electric vehicles in the region. According to the report by IEA, the sale of battery-powered electric vehicles touched 231,088 in the US in 2020. Furthermore, the presence of various automotive manufacturers in the region, is estimated to boost the market growth.

**Rising Need to Reduce Vehicle Weight to Boost the Market Growth**

Polymers reduce the overall weight and volume of the vehicle, which increases the overall mileage of the vehicle. As EV batteries are bulky and contribute to a major share of the overall weight of the vehicle, hence, EV manufacturers are increasingly opting for alternate materials that can lower the vehicle’s body weight. The growing use of polymer as a replacement for metals and alloys by the EV manufacturers is therefore estimated to boost the market growth.

However, slower rate of innovation in EVs is expected to operate as key restraint to the growth of the global electric vehicle polymers market over the forecast period.
