**Liquid Nitrogen Market Share, Trends and Competitive Analysis 2036**

Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Liquid Nitrogen Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/liquid-nitrogen-market/3638): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global liquid nitrogen market in terms of market segmentation by storage type, function, technology, end-user, and by region. 

**Growing Demand for Liquid Nitrogen in Industrial Gas and Electronic Industry to Promote Global Market Share of Liquid Nitrogen**

Over the course of the forecast period, rising demand for liquid nitrogen is anticipated to drive the market in applications for industrial gases and electronic devices. Industrial gases, including those used in the food, electronics, construction, and chemical industries, are crucial to every production industry. It is also used as a semiconductor in the electronics industry. As per a report, Apple dominates the smartphone and tablet marketplaces in terms of corporations, with about 50% and 55% of the market share, respectively. Despite having smaller market shares, Samsung is still a big player in both sectors. These elements are fueling market expansion.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global liquid nitrogen market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Increasing Infrastructural Activities
- Increasing Use of Liquid Nitrogen in Automotive Sector

**Challenges:**

Liquid nitrogen can be harmful to the body if it is not used appropriately, at the right temperature, and in the right amount. Cold burns may occur if a cryogenic liquid gas comes into direct contact with the body. It is therefore projected that its detrimental impacts on human health will limit market growth.

By technology, the global liquid nitrogen market is segmented into cryogenic distillation and pressure swing adsorption. During the projection period, the sector for cryogenic distillation is anticipated to have a sizeable proportion of 56%. The development can be attributed to the expanding application of cryogenic distillation technology in the manufacture of semiconductors for automobiles and other semiconductor devices. Additionally, this method makes it possible to produce industrial gases like nitrogen, argon, and oxygen at a low cost. Moreover, due to its inexpensive starting cost and low utility requirements, it is widely employed to create liquified industrial gases. As per a report, the industrial gas sector is expected to surpass USD 147 billion by the end of 2028. Cryogenic distillation is also used to clean gases like oxygen, carbon monoxide, argon, and light hydrocarbons. These elements are intensifying the expansion.
