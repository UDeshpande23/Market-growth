Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Thermosetting Plastics Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/thermosetting-plastics-market/5892): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global thermosetting plastics market in terms of market segmentation by type, molding process, end-user industry and by region. 

**Growing Demand for Bio-Based Thermosetting Plastics to Promote Global Market Share of Thermosetting Plastics Market**

The global thermosetting plastics market is estimated to grow majorly on account of the increased demand for polyurethane in the automotive industry. Some common uses of thermoset plastics across numerous industries and sectors include water & gas pipelines, medical equipment, storage boxes, and construction machinery parts. Since the thermosetting plastics are flexible and lightweight. Thermoset composites remain stable at all temperatures and in all ambiance. For instance, Bakelite is the most common thermoset plastic that is widely used in kitchenware, jewelry, children's toys, and pipe stems. Bakelite is also used in making switches because of its poor conductivity to electricity and heat. Other than this, epoxy resin is also applied to floors and various other surfaces to add tough coating. The global epoxy resin production stood at almost 3600 thousand tonnes in the year 2022. On the back of the rising utilization of thermoset plastics on various devices, the global thermosetting plastics market is anticipated to grow during the forecasted period. Other than this, the rising growth in the construction industry and rising demand for polyurethane in the automotive industry. Also, the advent of bio-based plastics is likely to showcase growth opportunities for the global thermosetting plastics market during the forecasted period. The properties such as chemical resistance, heat resistance, and structural integrity of the thermoset plastics are also going to augment the growth of the global thermosetting plastics market during the forecasted period.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global thermosetting plastics market are:

**Growth Drivers:**

- Rising Demand for Bio-depended Thermosetting Plastics 
- Surging Utilization of Thermosetting Plastics Making Kitchen Utensils  

**Challenges:**

The rising feedstock crunch and exorbitant cost of thermosetting plastics, stringent government policies, and problems related to manufacturing techniques are some of the major factors anticipated to hamper the global market size of the global thermosetting plastics market. 

By type, the global thermosetting plastics market is segmented into unsaturated polyesters, polyurethanes, phenolic, epoxy, amino, alkyd, vinyl, and ester. Out of these, the unsaturated polyesters segment is expected to grow the most during the forecasted period. The growth can be attributed to the outstanding thermal opposition and high creep power of the materials.
